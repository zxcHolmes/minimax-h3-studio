# MiniMax-H3 Studio

A self-hosted web studio for [MiniMax-H3](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/MiniMax-H3) audio-video generation on a single GPU machine. It drives ComfyUI as a Python library (no ComfyUI UI, no workflow JSON) so it can use the quantized ComfyUI checkpoints and ComfyUI's dynamic VRAM offloading, and puts a resident job server and a browser UI in front of it.

- **Text to video**, **image to video** (first frame, or first + last frame) and **reference images to video** (up to 6 subjects).
- Turbo LoRAs (4 / 8 steps) from [lightx2v](https://huggingface.co/lightx2v/Minimax-h3-Turbo) and [larryvrh](https://huggingface.co/larryvrh/MiniMax-H3-Turbo-Lora), selectable per job; the base model follows the mode automatically.
- FastVideo's distilled [FastH3](https://huggingface.co/FastVideo/FastVideo-FastH3-Comfy) 8-step checkpoints as a second model group that runs without a LoRA.
- Weights stay loaded between jobs; jobs run one at a time from a persistent queue.
- Output is pixel-identical to the official ComfyUI example workflows with the same settings.
- One script deploys the server and UI to a GPU machine over SSH; another downloads every checkpoint.

On an RTX 4090 a 5-second clip with sound takes about 40–60 s at 544p and 80–100 s at 768p.

## Requirements

**GPU machine** (where generation runs)

- Linux with an NVIDIA GPU. Developed on an RTX 4090 24 GB with 125 GB RAM; checkpoints are memory-mapped, so plenty of system RAM (64 GB+) and a fast SSD help.
- A [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) checkout with MiniMax-H3 support (developed against v0.42) and its Python environment (conda or venv). **You install ComfyUI yourself**; this project only imports it.
- systemd, and `sudo` without a password prompt for the deploy user (the deploy script installs and restarts a systemd unit over non-interactive SSH).
- `python3`, `curl` and `rsync`.
- Optional, about 2× faster: `triton` and `sageattention` in the ComfyUI environment (enabled through `H3_COMFY_ARGS`).
- Optional, for the larryvrh LoRA: its ComfyUI node, `git clone https://github.com/larryvrh/ComfyUI-MiniMax-H3-Turbo <ComfyUI>/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-MiniMax-H3-Turbo`.

**Your machine** (where you deploy from): Node.js 18+, `ssh` with key-based login to the GPU machine, `rsync`, and `scp`.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/minimax-h3-studio && cd minimax-h3-studio
cp .env.example .env          # then edit it, see Configuration
./deploy.sh models            # download ~72 GB of checkpoints into ComfyUI/models on the GPU machine
./deploy.sh                   # build the UI, install the server, start it
```

Open `http://<gpu-host>:8190`. The first start loads the text encoder and VAEs; the UI shows when the server is ready.

## Configuration

Everything machine-specific lives in `.env` (git-ignored; never commit it). `.env.example` documents each value. Variables already set in your shell take precedence over `.env`.

| Variable | Required | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `H3_DEPLOY_HOST` | yes | | SSH target of the GPU machine, e.g. `me@10.0.0.5` |
| `H3_COMFYUI` | yes | | ComfyUI checkout on the GPU machine |
| `H3_CONDA_ENV` | | `comfyui` | Conda env that runs ComfyUI |
| `H3_CONDA_SH` | | `~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh` | conda init script to source |
| `H3_PYTHON` | | | Absolute path of a Python interpreter (venv); overrides the conda settings |
| `H3_DEPLOY_DIR` | | `~/minimax-h3-studio` | Install directory on the GPU machine (code, UI and `data/`) |
| `H3_SERVICE_USER` | | SSH user | User the service runs as |
| `H3_SERVICE` | | `h3-server` | systemd unit name |
| `H3_HOST` / `H3_PORT` | | `0.0.0.0` / `8190` | Address the server listens on |
| `H3_COMFY_ARGS` | | `--enable-triton-backend --use-sage-attention` | Extra ComfyUI CLI flags; set it empty if triton / sageattention are not installed |
| `HF_ENDPOINT` | | `https://huggingface.co` | Hugging Face mirror for model downloads |
| `HF_TOKEN` | | | Token for gated or private repos |
| `H3_API` | | `http://<deploy host>:<port>` | Where `npm run dev` proxies API calls |

## Models

`./deploy.sh models` runs `scripts/prepare_models.py` on the GPU machine. It downloads exactly what the server is configured to use (the list comes from `server/h3_engine.py`), skips files that already exist and resumes interrupted downloads. You can also run it directly on the GPU machine; it needs only Python's standard library:

```bash
python3 scripts/prepare_models.py --comfyui /path/to/ComfyUI
python3 scripts/prepare_models.py --list                    # show files and sources
python3 scripts/prepare_models.py --comfyui ... --skip ref2va fasth3
```

Groups for `--skip`: `shared`, `fl2va`, `ref2va`, `lightx2v`, `larryvrh`, `fasth3`. With `./deploy.sh models`, extra arguments are passed through (`./deploy.sh models --skip ref2va`).

| File | Folder | Source | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| `qwen3vl_32b_minimax_h3_nvfp4_awq` (text encoder) | `text_encoders` | Comfy-Org/MiniMax-H3 | 15.7 GB |
| `minimax_h3_video_vae_fp16`, `minimax_h3_audio_vae_fp32` | `vae` | Comfy-Org/MiniMax-H3 | 5.8 GB |
| `minimax_h3_fl2va_pruned_int8_convrot` (text / image to video) | `diffusion_models` | Comfy-Org/MiniMax-H3 | 21 GB |
| `minimax_h3_ref2va_pruned_int8_convrot` (reference to video) | `diffusion_models` | Comfy-Org/MiniMax-H3 | 21 GB |
| lightx2v fl2v / ref2v turbo LoRAs (4 files) | `loras` | lightx2v/Minimax-h3-Turbo | 2 GB each |
| `minimax_h3_turbo_v4_step600_ema` | `loras` | larryvrh/MiniMax-H3-Turbo-Lora | 0.8 GB |
| `fastvideo_fasth3_8step_v2_pruned_int8_convrot` (FastH3, text / image) | `diffusion_models` | FastVideo/FastVideo-FastH3-Comfy | 22 GB |
| `fasth3_omniref_8step_pruned_int8_convrot` (FastH3, reference) | `diffusion_models` | FastVideo/FastH3-Omni-Comfy | 22 GB |

The models are under their own licenses (MiniMax-H3 Community License for the base checkpoints); review them before use.

## Using the studio

| Mode | Base model | Inputs |
|---|---|---|
| Text | fl2va | prompt |
| Image | fl2va | first frame, optional last frame |
| Reference | ref2va | 1–6 images, each with a short subject description |

Prompts are edited in three sections: picture, sound and music. Reference mode builds the official ref2va prompt layout (subject definitions, summary, retention) from the images and their descriptions; refer to them as `<Subject 1>`, `<Subject 2>`... Switch to the raw prompt view to see or edit the full text. Job cards show the first lines of the prompt; long prompts expand with Show more.

Models come in two groups. **MiniMax-H3 + LoRA** runs the base model of the mode with a turbo LoRA (the recommended one is preselected):

| LoRA | Mode | Steps | Resolutions | 5 s clip on a 4090 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| lightx2v 8-step v1.0 | text / image | 8 | 544p | ~60 s |
| lightx2v 4-step v1.3 | text / image | 4 | 768p | ~80 s |
| larryvrh v4 | text / image | 4 | 544p, 768p | ~40 s / ~82 s |
| lightx2v ref2v v0.1 | reference | 4 | 544p, 768p | ~45 s / ~100 s |
| lightx2v ref2v v1.0 | reference | 4 | 768p | ~100 s |

**FastVideo FastH3** runs FastVideo's distilled 8-step checkpoints, which replace the base model and take no LoRA. They use the settings of the ComfyUI FastH3 templates, including comfy_kitchen attention with Video Sparse Attention (keep 10%):

| Model | Mode | Sampler | Shift | 5 s clip on a 4090 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FastH3 V2 8-step | text / image | res_multistep | 10/3 | ~55 s (544p) / ~110 s (768p) |
| FastH3 OmniRef 8-step | reference | euler | 12/3 | ~62 s (544p) / ~130 s (768p) |

OmniRef at 768p does not show the green banded glow of the ref2v LoRAs. FastH3 needs a comfy_kitchen build whose CUDA kernels match the driver (the cu13 wheel fails on CUDA 12.8 drivers; rebuild it from source with `COMFY_CUDA_ARCHS` set). Switching between groups swaps the resident base model, which takes about a second plus the first-use load from disk.

To add a LoRA, add an entry to `LORAS` in `server/h3_engine.py` (file, source repo, steps, sigma shift, resolutions), run `./deploy.sh models` and `./deploy.sh server`. The sigma shift must match what the LoRA was trained with.

## Deploying and operating

```bash
./deploy.sh            # UI + server (restarts the service)
./deploy.sh web        # UI only; no restart, loaded weights stay warm
./deploy.sh server     # server only (restarts the service)
./deploy.sh models     # download checkpoints
FORCE=1 ./deploy.sh server   # restart even while jobs are running or queued (they are lost)
```

On the GPU machine:

- Logs: `journalctl -u h3-server -f`
- Data: `$H3_DEPLOY_DIR/data/` (`jobs.db`, `videos/`, `thumbs/`, `uploads/`)
- Stop / start: `sudo systemctl stop h3-server` / `sudo systemctl start h3-server`

Running without the deploy script: build the UI (`cd web && npm install && npm run build`), copy the repo to the GPU machine and, inside the ComfyUI Python environment, run `H3_COMFYUI=/path/to/ComfyUI H3_WEB_DIST=web/dist python server/app.py`.

## HTTP API

| Method | Path | |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/health` | server state, running job, resident base model |
| GET | `/api/presets` | resolutions, model groups, LoRAs, default LoRA per mode and resolution |
| GET | `/api/jobs` | recent jobs |
| POST | `/api/jobs` | create a job (multipart form, below) |
| GET | `/api/jobs/{id}` | one job |
| POST | `/api/jobs/{id}/cancel` | cancel a queued or running job |
| DELETE | `/api/jobs/{id}` | delete a finished job and its files |

`POST /api/jobs` fields: `prompt`, `resolution` (`544p` / `768p`), `lora` (optional; a LoRA or FastH3 model id, defaults to the recommended LoRA), `duration` (2–15 s), `seed` (optional), `aspect_ratio` (`16:9`, `9:16`, `4:3`, `3:4`, `1:1`, or `image` to follow the input picture), and files `image`, `last_image` or repeated `ref_image`.

```bash
curl -F resolution=544p -F duration=5 -F aspect_ratio=16:9 \
  -F "prompt=integrated_multimodal_description: A red panda sips cocoa by a frosty window.

overall_soundscape: Crackling fireplace.

non_diegetic_music: N/A" http://<gpu-host>:8190/api/jobs
```

## Headless launcher

`comfy_launcher/run_h3.py` generates videos from the command line with the same pipeline, without the server. Run it on the GPU machine inside the ComfyUI environment:

```bash
python comfy_launcher/run_h3.py --comfyui /path/to/ComfyUI \
  --prompt-file prompt.txt --lora minimax_h3_fl2v_turbo_8step_v1.0_comfyui_bf16.safetensors \
  --steps 8 --width 960 --height 544 --duration 5 -- --enable-triton-backend --use-sage-attention
```

It also takes `--first-frame`, `--last-frame`, repeated `--ref-image`, `--jobs-json` for batches and `--lora-loader larryvrh`. For experiments: `--attention-backend` (`pytorch` or comfy_kitchen `kitchen` attention), `--vsa` / `--vsa-start` (Video Sparse Attention for FastH3 checkpoints) and `--save-frames` (also writes the decoded frames losslessly as `.npy`). See `--help`. `comfy_launcher/bench.sh` wraps it with GPU memory logging.

## Making an animated series

[doc/animated-short-workflow.md](doc/animated-short-workflow.md) describes how an agent such as Claude Code directs a multi-episode animated short through the HTTP API: a character bible with fixed looks and voices, casting clips that provide reference images, storyboards, reference-mode shots that keep characters consistent, QC, and assembling each episode with ffmpeg.

## Development

```bash
cd web && npm install && npm run dev
```

The dev server reads `.env` from the repo root and proxies `/api` and `/files` to the deployed server.
